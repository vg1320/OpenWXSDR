#  Description
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#  DFT-based radiosonde type detector for OpenWX.
#
#  Uses the dft_detect tool from the rs1729/RS repository to perform
#  correlation-based sonde identification against known sonde signatures.
#  This approach is significantly more accurate than bandwidth-based
#  detection and can reliably distinguish between RS41, RS92, DFM, M10
#  and iMet sondes with type-specific correlation thresholds.
#
#  Pipeline:
#    rtl_fm (FM demodulation, 48 kHz) → temp .raw file → dft_detect
#
#  Supported sonde types : RS41, RS92, DFM, M10, M20, iMet, LMS6
#  External dependency   : dft_detect (rs1729/RS, github.com/rs1729/RS)
